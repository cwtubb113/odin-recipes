      <p><em>This Greek honey cake recipe yields a very moist cake, often found at Greek food festivals.</em></p>
      <p>Prep Time: <strong>20 mins</strong></p>
      <p>Cook Time: <strong>55 mins</strong></p>
      <p>Serving Size: <strong>12</strong></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine honey, 1 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare the cake.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat remaining 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in flour mixture, alternating with milk, beating just until incorporated; stir in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove cake from oven and poke holes over the surface with a toothpick. Slowly ladle the cooled honey syrup over cake. For best results, set cake aside for 4 to 6 hours to cool and absorb the syrup before slicing and serving.</li>
      </ol>
